# Drumkit Project Website

This repository includes all the files used for the website to present on **Thursday the 15<sup>th</sup> of December**. 
The layout of the files is the following:
- `index.html`: This file is the file which will display when accessing the URL. It shall present a brief introduction to the project itself as well as an explanation of the Piezoelectric Effect and why it's useful for the project.
- `drum.html`: This file presents the _product_ page, including the final pictures of the assembled drumkit and the image map linked to the making of the different parts of the drumkit, where the used materials will be explained. There is an **issue** here as 
- `comp.html`: Complementary information on commercial products. 

In case you want to touch some code and are not sure how HTML/CSS work, [in this website](https://www.w3schools.com) you may find easy-to-follow tutorials on almost anything you may want to do, (it even includes try-it-yourself examples you may just copy). I mean, I don't know a lot but what I know I mainly learnt it from there and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
