### DRUMKIT PROJECT WEBSITE

This repository includes all the files used for the website to present (preferably) on **Tuesday the 13<sup>th</sup> of December**. 
The layout of the files is the following:
- `index.html`: This file is the file which will display when accessing the URL. It shall present a brief introduction to the project itself as well as an explanation of the Piezoelectric Effect and why it's useful for the project.
- `drum.html`: This file presents the _product_ page, including the final pictures of the assembled drumkit and the image map linked to the making of the different parts of the drumkit, where the used materials will be explained.
- `comp.html` (PROVISIONAL NAME, NOT UPLOADED YET): A comparison of the materials used in the project, those used in commercial electronic kits and some common acoustic ones. 

Any suggestions are welcome and you may type them below, send e-mails to the team members, discuss them in person or send a text message to the group.
