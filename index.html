          <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why piezoelectrics? </h3>
          <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Piezoelectric materials have special properties which result highly useful for this project.
          See, piezoelectrics are specific materials which, when brought under any sort of mechanical stresses,
          originate electrical charges. This way, piezoelectric materials conform an easy way to convert mechanical
          energy into electricity. <!-- HOW DOES THIS WORK? -->
          </p>
          <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how come the piezoelectric effect result indeed handful for the project? In the end, an electronic drumkit
          consists in a bunch of piezoelectrics connected to a module capable of reading electrical inputs and converting
          them to sound.
