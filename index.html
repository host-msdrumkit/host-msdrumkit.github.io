      <div style="display: block; text-align: justify; margin: 25px 30px;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ever wondered how do electronic drumkits resemble traditional drumkits and manage to give such subtle tones that many drummers prefer them to acoustic kits to record music? <br>
      <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is fairly simple: <strong>Piezoelectric materials!</strong> <br>
      <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; This website explains some aspects on the building of a cheap, homemade electronic drumkit with piezoelectric discs (and it's actually somewhat playable!)

          <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why piezoelectrics? </h3>
          <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Piezoelectric materials are ferroelectric ceramics with some special properties which result highly useful for this project.
          See, piezoelectrics are specific materials which, when brought under any sort of mechanical stress,
          originate electrical charges. This way, piezoelectric materials conform an easy way to convert mechanical
          energy into electrical energy, through what is known as the <a onclick = togglepiezo() class = falselink> direct piezoelectric effect</a>. <!-- HOW DOES THIS WORK? REDO ENTIRELY. TALK ABOUT DIRECT PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT-->
          </p>
          <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how come the piezoelectric effect result indeed handful for the project? In the end, an electronic drumkit
          consists in a bunch of piezoelectrics connected to a module capable of reading electrical inputs and converting
          them to sound. Each pad shall have their own piezoelectric disc acting as a hitting sensor, which shall then deliver an electrical signal to a processing unit (in this case, an Arduino nano plate). Furthermore, since the intensity of the undergone stress by the discs is related to the induced current by the effect, one can determine the intensity of the hits and play with their volume.</p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The project pads therefore include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_zirconate_titanate" target="_blank" class = falselink> PZT discs</a>, which is a commercial piezoelectric ceramic which consists of lead, oxygen, zirconium and titanium atoms.

            <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct piezoelectric effect </h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated, compressing a piezoelectric material produces electricity. A piezoceramic material is placed between the two metal plates.

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In piezoelectric crystals, the unit cell is not symmetrical, and the electrical charges are perfectly balanced, therefore
              piezoelectric crystals are electrically neutral. However, stretching or squeezing a piezoelectric crystal deforms the structure, pushing some
              of the atoms closer together or further apart. This upsets the balance of positive and negative, and causes net electrical charges to appear.
              This effect continues through the whole crystal structure so net positive and negative charges appear on opposite, outer faces of the crystal.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; As a curiosity, there also exists an <a class = "falselink" href = "https://www.elprocus.com/what-is-the-piezoelectric-effect-working-and-its-applications/" target = "_blank"> inverse piezoelectric effect </a>, thanks to which piezoelectric materials (and PZT does this) change their shape when having an electric voltage difference applied on. This effect finds uses in engines, positioning-control devices and ultrasonic signal generators, among other things.
